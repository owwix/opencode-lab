# Agent filesystem safety

These rules apply to every modifying OpenCode profile and managed run.

Approval policy is selected by the host launcher and mounted read-only into the
agent container. The public default is `safe-auto`; `ask` disables automatic
replies, and `broad-auto` expands non-shell automation only. No mode can
auto-approve shell execution, credentials, publishing, external directories, or
hard-denied tools. Change it from the host with
`lab --approval-mode ask|safe-auto|broad-auto`, never from project code.

- Resolve and inspect every exact deletion target inside the confirmed workspace
  before acting. Stop and ask when the target or scope is ambiguous. Never target
  the workspace root, a home directory, or anything outside the workspace.
- Raw removal commands and improvised deletion scripts are prohibited. Create a
  bound plan with
  `node /opencode-config/scripts/security/safe-remove.mjs plan <exact-relative-paths>`,
  show its exact targets, and execute that unchanged plan only after approval with
  `node /opencode-config/scripts/security/safe-remove.mjs execute <plan-path>`.
  Execution moves unchanged targets into a fresh `.agent-trash` recovery directory.
- Create scratch directories with `mktemp -d`, `mkdtemp`, or the platform
  equivalent. Never reuse a shared predictable temporary path.
- Never assign to or repurpose system environment variables such as `HOME`, `PATH`,
  `SHELL`, `TMPDIR`, or `CODEX_HOME`. Use a task-specific variable name.
- Prefer recoverable actions. If secure irreversible erasure is genuinely required,
  stop and obtain explicit authority for that separate operation.
- The selected project is already mounted at `/workspace`. Do not instruct the
  user to clone it or install dependencies on their laptop.
- For local run/preview of any project, follow
  `/opencode-config/.opencode/skills/local-preview/SKILL.md` and `/preview`.
  Bind app servers to container `0.0.0.0:3000` / `0.0.0.0:3001` (or publish
  `127.0.0.1:3100` / `127.0.0.1:3101` from workspace compose). Tell the user to
  open only `http://127.0.0.1:3100` and `http://127.0.0.1:3101` on the Mac.
  Never mention Codespaces, Gitpod, VS Code Ports, or SSH tunnels.
