## OpenCode

OpenCode Lab invokes pinned OpenCode container images but does not redistribute
the OpenCode source tree. OpenCode remains a separate upstream project. See the
image pin in `Dockerfile.opencode` and the upstream project for its current
license and notices.

## Dependency manifests

`package-lock.json`, `quality/inspect/uv.lock`, and the Hound requirements lock
files enumerate independently licensed packages. Those lock files are
classified as `attributed-upstream`; each dependency remains governed by the
license published with that package.
