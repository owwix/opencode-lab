# OpenCode Lab

Docker-isolated [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) harness: mount any
project, route models through a local credential gateway, and keep secrets out
of the agent container.

OpenCode Lab is an independent project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by,
or sponsored by OpenCode or its maintainers. OpenCode is a separate upstream
project and its name and trademarks remain with their respective owners.

Core is product-neutral. Company agents, commands, themes, contracts, and run
skills load from external versioned packs and are not stored in this repository.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop
- Node.js 24 (`nvm use` reads `.nvmrc`)
- Cloudflare Workers Paid (for default Kimi / Workers AI models)

## Quick start

```bash
cp opencode.env.example opencode.env
# Fill CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID and CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (optional OpenAI / Vertex)
npm install
npm run opencode
# or:
npm run opencode -- --workspace "$HOME/Projects/some-app"
```

Install a global launcher (optional):

```bash
npm link
lab --setup
lab open "$HOME/Projects/some-app"
```

macOS shortcut: `launch-opencode.command`.

## Project lifecycle

The `lab` launcher works from any directory. With no path, `lab open` uses the
workspace picker; `lab new` creates one exact empty directory before opening it.
Recent projects and active launches come from the host-owned project registry,
not from files written into a mounted repository.

```bash
lab open [path]
lab new [path]
lab recent                    # add --json for machine-readable output
lab status                    # foreground + background activity
lab stop                      # SIGTERM only after verifying the launcher PID
lab resume [index|name|path]
lab init [path] [--pack id] [--yes] # preview and approve contract v1
lab doctor [path]
lab prune [--apply]
lab version
lab update [--ref REF]
lab rollback
```

The v0.x forms remain aliases: `opencode-lab`, `--workspace <path>`, managed
`task` commands, and `--setup` continue to work.

Projects may commit `.opencode-lab/project.json` to declare install, verify,
development, preview, artifact, risk, and enabled-pack metadata. Without it,
Lab uses a read-only detected contract. See the
[project contract reference](docs/project-contract.md).
Runtime compatibility, staged updates, backups, and rollback are documented in
the [compatibility reference](docs/compatibility.md).

Every open runs a project preflight before Docker starts. It reports the Git
root and cleanliness, supported runtime/package manager, verification commands,
preview-port listeners, local ignore setup, and managed-run eligibility. A
declared unsupported executable stops with a remediation instead of failing
inside the container later.

## Tool profiles and rebuilds

The default interactive launch is the fast coding profile: it starts the
required credential gateway and state initializer, while Hound and OpenDesign
stay disabled. Generic research selects Hound automatically; loaded packs
declare whether their agents require research or design tooling.

```bash
lab open --with-research               # Hound only
lab open --with-design                 # OpenDesign only
lab open --full-tools                  # both optional stacks
lab open --rebuild --with-research     # rebuild only core + research images
```

Launcher-only flags are removed before OpenCode starts. Warm launches reuse
images; use `--rebuild` after changing a Dockerfile or image build input.
Switching agents with Tab during an existing interactive session cannot start a
new tool stack: relaunch with `--with-research` or `--with-design` first.

Lab keeps one foreground interactive workspace. Opening another shows the
canonical path and PID of the active launch, then offers to resume it or stop it
before opening the new project. Background managed runs register separately and
continue without taking foreground ownership. Project/session/helper ownership
is recorded in the host-owned OpenCode Lab state directory; no project receives
the launch registration token or access to that registry. On macOS this is
`~/Library/Application Support/OpenCode Lab/state`. Preferences live beside it
under the host-owned `config` directory. Runtime config, run state, logs, and
approval preferences are never created in a selected repository.

Lab adds only compatibility patterns to the repository-local
`.git/info/exclude`; it does not edit `.gitignore`. Credential files that
already exist are masked with empty read-only mounts. Missing `.env`, `.npmrc`,
and related paths are redirected inside the container, so Docker does not
create empty placeholders in the project.

## What stays in Docker

| Piece              | Role                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenCode container | TUI + agents; Node/npm/pnpm/Git; scoped gateway token only       |
| Agent gateway      | Real CF / Vertex / Quality credentials; model allowlist          |
| Hound              | On-demand research profile; isolated through its fixed relay     |
| OpenDesign         | On-demand design profile; separate scoped daemon token           |
| opencode-preview   | Mac `3100`/`3101` → app `:3000`/`:3001` (skipped if ports taken) |
| Gallery            | Host `http://127.0.0.1:3110` for safe image artifacts            |
| Browser relays     | Verify `:3111`, interactive session `:3112` (Playwright on Mac)  |

## Agents (Tab)

**Coding lanes for ordinary prompts:** **fast** (GLM-4.7 Flash, small low-risk
changes), **lab** (GPT-OSS 120B, standard/default), and **deep** (Kimi K2.7
Code, complex or high-risk work). Choose the lane with Tab before the coding
prompt; models do not switch automatically mid-turn.

**Workflow agents (always):** **plan**, **research**, **dispatcher**, and
**reviewer**. Managed `/ship` and `/parallel` runs use their separate task router.

**Extensions:** project-local `.opencode` files and enabled external packs add
agents and commands without changing core. See `docs/packs.md`,
`docs/lab/workspace-agents.md`, and `docs/lab/when-to-use-agents.md`.

## Local preview contract

Inside Lab, apps bind `:3000` / `:3001`. On the Mac open only:

- `http://127.0.0.1:3100`
- `http://127.0.0.1:3101`

Never Codespaces / VS Code Ports. Skills: `local-preview`, `project-skills`, and
workspace or loaded-pack `run-*-dev` contributions.

## Useful commands

```text
/agents-help /workflow /plan /ship /parallel /research /review /eval /runs
/checkpoint /rewind /compact /recap /preview /run-local /browser /gallery
/view /publish /notion
```

The [CLI/configuration reference](docs/cli-reference.md) documents every core
lifecycle flag, approval mode, operator environment variable, slash command,
and exit behavior.

```bash
npm run lab:background -- --workspace ~/Projects/app --prompt "…"
npm run lab:fleet -- enqueue --workspace ~/Projects/app --prompt "A" --prompt "B"
npm run lab:browser:setup
npm run lab:browser -- http://127.0.0.1:3100
```

Foreground, background, parallel, and fleet work use the same durable run
records. Lab reconciles interrupted heartbeats at startup, preserves a Git
recovery ref for every managed worktree, and refuses cleanup while changes are
dirty or have not been adopted/published.

Open `/runs` in the TUI (or press `Ctrl+Shift+R`) to inspect and operate those
runs. The project-scoped control center shows phase, state, models, elapsed
time, observed cost, approvals, verification, review, worktree, artifacts,
preview, and pull-request status. Quality claims include their concrete
evidence path; unavailable provider cost telemetry is labeled unavailable,
never `$0`.

## Safety

- Workspace credential files are masked; use `safe-git.mjs` / `safe-remove.mjs`
- Tool lifecycle plugin audits/blocks dangerous bash and credential paths
- OpenCode has no direct outbound network; model, browser, research, design,
  preview, publishing, and approved downloads cross fixed-purpose relays
- Host browser relays require the current scoped launch capability and run under
  macOS seatbelt when available
- Sessions, configuration, caches, and optional-service state use project-ID
  namespaced volumes, so one project cannot inherit another project's state
- Gallery, browser, preview, quality, GitHub, and companion helpers are reused
  only when their reported project ID and workspace hash match the launch
- Container: `read_only`, `cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, optional bwrap

The supported trust boundaries, attacker model, and known experimental limits
are documented in the [threat model](docs/threat-model.md). The public core has
no outbound product telemetry in v0.x. Company-specific agents, destinations,
credentials, evaluation cases, and operating policy belong in private packs;
see the [public/private product boundary](docs/product-boundary.md).

## Verify

```bash
npm run test:lab
npm run quality:test   # broader Lab + quality suite
npm run provenance:check
npm run release:test
